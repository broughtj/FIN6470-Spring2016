At the close of trading on day 1, the share price increased to $\\$40.50$ and we had to purchase $3.18$ shares to rebalance the portfolio for a total of $61.42$ shares.

As the stock price falls, the delta of the call decreases and the call makes money more slowly than the fixed stock position loses money.\"___ She becomes unhedged net long as the stock price falls and unhedged net short as the stock price rises.

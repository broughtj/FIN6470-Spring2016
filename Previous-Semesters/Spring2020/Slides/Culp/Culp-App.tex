\protect\hypertarget{epigraph}{}
\begin{quote}
\emph{``There are basically two kinds of philosophy: prickles and goo.
Prickly people are precise and logical - they like everything chopped up
and clear. On the other hand, goo people like it vague. In physics,
prickly people are those who believe that the ultimate constituency of
matter is particles, whereas goo people believe in waves. In philosophy,
prickly people are logical positivists, and goo people are idealists.
And they're always arguing with each other. But neither could take a
position without the other perosn, because you wouldn't know that you
advocated prickles unless there were someone out there advocating goo.
You can't know a prickle without the goo. And life is neither prickles
nor goo - it's gooey prickles and prickly goo.''} -- Alan Watts (Out of
Your Mind pp.~17-18)

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\protect\hypertarget{introduction}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``One of the most important concepts in both economics and finance is
  the notion of \emph{equilibrium}''
\item
  It may surprise you to discover that there is not universally agreed
  upon definition of equilibrium.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We will be discussing several different views of equilibrium
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Invoking an equilibrium concept is the way that \textbf{\emph{most}}
  economic models operate. So understanding the basic ideas are crucial.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Relevance of Economic Theory}
\protect\hypertarget{the-relevance-of-economic-theory}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The economist Lionel Robbins wrote \emph{``the science which studies
  human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which
  have alternative uses''} (Robbins, 1932, p.~16)
\item
  This is the basic idea of neoclassical equilibrium, at least as
  painted with \emph{very} broad brush strokes
\item
  Hayek and Buchanan take issue with this definition

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Hayek proposed a definition of equilibrium as the coordination of
    individual plans
  \item
    Buchanan proposed that economists study \textbf{\emph{catallactics}}
    or \textbf{\emph{symbiotics}}
  \item
    These two views are practically the same, but Buchanan fills in some
    of the details about what Hayek meant (we are very grateful for
    that)
  \item
    The basic view takes into account the dynamic nature of the market
    and conceives of it fundamentally as a \textbf{\emph{process}}
  \item
    Buchanan felt so strongly that he proposed that he might not be an
    \textbf{\emph{economist}} (he meant that if Robbins's definition is
    accepted, then he was not that)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Culp's Take}
\protect\hypertarget{culps-take}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``But at the day-to-day level of corporate decision making,
  economic theory has been so marginalized that it is viewed as being
  largely irrelevant.''}
\item
  \emph{``\textbf{\textit{Everyone}} outside the economic profession has
  probably at one time or another regarded economists as overly
  theoretical and abstract creatures disconnected from the operations of
  `the real world.'\,''}
\item
  The main reason:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``\ldots{} a self-inflicted wound for which economists have
    only themselves to blame.''}
  \item
    \emph{``scholarly economics journals and studies have over the years
    become increasingly reliant on highly mathematical and technical
    modeling approaches.''}
  \item
    \emph{``Paradoxically, the better the economist by most current
    metrics of the profession, the less likely it is that an average
    person with a B.A. from a liberal arts school will be able to digest
    what they say and write.''}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My Take}
\protect\hypertarget{my-take}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Culp doesn't quite convince me that this is why. He's warm though.
\item
  If the highly mathematical models were predictive, then firms would
  gladly hire talent that can understand and implement them.
\item
  Look at the role of \textbf{\emph{quants}} on Wall Street. This
  suggests that finance models have some empirical and predictive
  content.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Wall Street hires more physicists than all other hiring sources
    combined!
  \item
    Q: What is the world market for DSGE models outside of academia and
    government?!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Also see what is happening around \textbf{\emph{Data Science}} right
  now. A PhD in statistics, computer science or electrical engineering
  is a hot ticket!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Relevance Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{relevance-continued}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The classical economists were not marginalized, but rather were seen
  as quite important members of society!
\item
  \emph{``Historically, economics was neither a science nor a subject
  aimed primarily at the intellectual.''}
\item
  \emph{``A second reason for the marginalization of economic theory
  today must surely be the widespread perception {[}of{]} its general
  failure as a science.''}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ouch! Harsh! But true?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physics vs Economics}
\protect\hypertarget{physics-vs-economics}{}
\begin{quote}
\emph{``An example will suffice to illustrate the point. In physics, the
law of gravity says that when an apple becomes detached from the tree,
it will fall to the ground. No matter how much data you collect, this
will be true 100 percent of the time. In economics, the criteria for
determining `success' of models are much laxer. The law of demand, for
example, states that the price someone is willing to pay for a good is
inversely proportional to the quantity demanded - that is `demand
curves' slope down.''}
\end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Schools of Economic Thought And Characterizations of
Equilibrium}
\protect\hypertarget{schools-of-economic-thought-and-characterizations-of-equilibrium}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Economics began with Adam Smith's publication of \emph{The Wealth of
  Nations}
\item
  It is notable that Smith was a \textbf{\emph{moral philosopher}} and
  not a mathematician or a physical scientist
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical Period}
\protect\hypertarget{classical-period}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Smith's WON was published in 1776 (a good year for very important
  documents)
\item
  Classical economists:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Adam Smith (a moral philosopher)
  \item
    David Ricardo (member of parliament)
  \item
    Karl Marx (journalist and revolutionary)
  \item
    John Stuart Mill (philosopher)
  \item
    Thomas Malthus (member of parliament)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Labor theory of value
\item
  Belief that most things in the economy tended towards some
  \emph{natural rate}
\item
  \emph{``The tendency of supply shifts to cause a convergence between
  market and natural rates is essentially the Classical or Ricardian
  definition of an equilibrium.''}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Marginalist Revolution and the Neoclassical Period}
\protect\hypertarget{the-marginalist-revolution-and-the-neoclassical-period}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The birth of the neoclassical period is credited to William Stanley
  Jevons and Leon Walras

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Jevons: LOOP
  \item
    Walras: father of mathematical method in economics. Simultaneous
    equations for supply and demand. Auctioneer who clears markets.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Carl Menger was also a key figure (would become the father of the
  Austrian school)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Harshly criticized Marx's labor theory of value
  \item
    Originated the concept of subjective value
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Jevons, Walras and Menger originated the \textbf{``marginal
  revolution''}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Market value of goods and factors of production were determined ``at
    the margin'' between the forces of supply and demand
  \item
    Intro Micro: \(MR = MC\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Marginal Revolution Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{the-marginal-revolution-continued}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Jevon's LOOP

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``identical goods of uniform quality must sell for the same
    price.''}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Walras

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``Walras argued that the market price of a good was the price
    at which supply and demand curves intersected.''}
  \item
    One of the first to discuss the concept of \emph{marginal utility}
  \item
    \emph{``What Walras did not do, however, was contemplate any realist
    adjustment mechanism by which the market forces of supply and demand
    were reconciled\ldots. Instead, Walras merely supposed the existence
    of an auctioneer who literally called out prices.''}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Marginal Revolution Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{the-marginal-revolution-continued-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Edgeworth refined Walrasian equilibrium by introducing the possibility
  of \emph{recontracting}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``Economic agents would simple amend their prior price
    agreements''}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Marshall: developed the concepts of \emph{short run} and \emph{long
  run}
\item
  \emph{``Only imperfect competition can explain positive long-run
  profits in a Marshallian equilibrium.''}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary of The Neoclassical School}
\protect\hypertarget{summary-of-the-neoclassical-school}{}
The basic tenets of the neoclassical school include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The law of one price
\item
  The distinctions between short-run and long-run behavior of market
  participants and markets
\item
  The inability of firms to earn positive economic profits in the long
  run in a perfectly competitive market
\item
  Returns to scale in production; nonsatiation and diminishing marginal
  utility in consumption
\item
  Market efficiency
\item
  Equilibrium is seen as a balance of forces
\item
  Nothing interesting about \emph{disequilibrium}, since it is seen as a
  momentary state that cannot persist
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Menger and the Austrian Critique}
\protect\hypertarget{menger-and-the-austrian-critique}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The so-called \textbf{\emph{``Austrian School''}} gets its name from
  the fact that Menger was an Austrian

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Curious fact: there are not current ``Austrian'' economists living
    in Austria
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``The Austrian school was quickly marginalized''}
\item
  Capital theory of Bohm-Bawerk (1891) and Lachmann (1978)
\item
  Nobelists F.A. Hayek and Sir John Hicks (who also accepted by
  neoclassicals)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Menger Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{menger-continued}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``Menger (1871) deserves probably as much credit as Walras
  (1874) for recognizing the role of marginal utility in governing
  consumption optimality. But unlike Walras and other neoclassicals,
  Menger (1871) advanced the theory of \textbf{subjective value}, which
  held that each individual's values and utilities were subjective,
  relative, dependent on the psychology and wants of that particular
  individual, and - imporantly - not directly comparable across
  different economic agents.''}
\item
  Noeclassical economics tends to stress objective and knowable
  quantities
\item
  Austrian economics tends to stress subjective and unknowable quanities
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Menger Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{menger-continued-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``The neoclassical theory of equilibrium essentially postulates
  an equilibrium as a balance of forces - supply and demand - that lead
  to either a state of rest or a steady state of uniform motion in a
  system.''}
\item
  \emph{``In the Austrian theory, equilibrium can be better defined as a
  situation in which knowledge and expectations lead to consistent
  plans. Hayek (1937) defines and equilibrium as a situation in which
  `the different plans which the individuals composing {[}an economic
  system{]} have made for action in time are mutually compatible.' To
  Austrians, equilibrium thus is more of a \textbf{tendency} than a
  stationary or steady state.''}
\item
  \emph{``\ldots{} perhaps the richest insights from the Austrian school
  thus are not its analyses of equilibrium, but rather its analysis of
  \textbf{disequilibrium}.''}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Menger Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{menger-continued-2}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``In the Austrian paradigm, disequilibrium is basically the
  constant state of affairs. Markets still \textbf{tend} toward
  equilibrium, but the constant changes in information, knowledge, and
  expectations of individuals make the market much more of a
  \textbf{process} than a state of nature.''}
\item
  What if the Austrians were right? That would mean there is no
  Marshallian long-run state towards which the market is inevitably
  moving. This would imply that some form of stable situation exists in
  which profits are possible and information is not equal across market
  participants.
\item
  I should - here as elsewhere - acknowledge my heresy to be honest in
  advertising
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hick's Neo-Austrian Middle Ground}
\protect\hypertarget{hicks-neo-austrian-middle-ground}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sir John Hicks called himself a \textbf{\textit{neo-Austrian}}
\item
  Hicks adopted Hayek's notion of equilibrium as a consistency in plans
  (in most of his work)
\item
  He fundamentally disagreed with Marshall about a clean separation
  between short and long run.
\item
  He embraced these Austrian concepts without giving up the standard
  tools of formal economic analysis (pioneered by Jevons and Walras)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Neo-Austrian Continued}
\protect\hypertarget{neo-austrian-continued}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In this class we essentially retain the core features of the
  neoclassical paradigm (LOOP, marginalism, rising supply price, etc)
\item
  \textbf{\emph{But}} we remain openly sympathetic to the Austrian
  critique and to the view of the market as a process, equilibrium as a
  consistency of plans
\item
  \emph{``it becomes quite hard to explain a lot of financial and
  derivatives market activity without being
  \textbf{a little bit Austrian}''}
\end{itemize}

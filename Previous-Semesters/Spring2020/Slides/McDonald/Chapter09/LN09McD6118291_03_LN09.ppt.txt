Parity and Other Option Relationships

Put-Call Parity
For European options with the same strike price and time to expiration the parity relationship is
Call – put = PV (forward price – strike price)
or
Intuition
Buying a call and selling a put with the strike equal to the forward price (F0,T = K) creates a synthetic forward contract and hence must have a zero price

Parity for Options on Stocks
If underlying asset is a stock and PV0,T(Div) is the present value of the dividends payable over the life of the option, then e-rT F0,T = S0 – PV0,T (Div), therefore
Rewriting above
For index options,                              , therefore

Parity for Options on Stocks (cont’d)
Examples 9.1 & 9.2
Price of a non-dividend-paying stock: $40, r=8%, option strike price: $40, time to expiration: 3 months, European call: $2.78, European put: $1.99.       $2.78=$1.99+$40 – $40e -0.08x0.25
Additionally, if the stock pays $5 just before expiration, call: $0.74, and put: $4.85.      $0.74-$4.85=($40 – $5e-0.08x0.25) – $40e-0.08x0.25
Synthetic security creation using parity
Synthetic stock: buy call, sell put, lend PV of strike and dividends
Synthetic T-bill: buy stock, sell call, buy put (conversion)
Synthetic call: buy stock, buy put, borrow PV of strike and dividends 
Synthetic put: sell stock, buy call, lend PV of strike and dividends

Properties of Option Prices
European versus American Options
Since an American option can be exercised at anytime, whereas a European option can only be exercised at expiration, an American option must always be at least as valuable as an otherwise identical European option
CAmer(S, K, T) > CEur(S, K, T) 
PAmer(S, K, T) > PEur(S, K, T)

Properties of Option Prices (cont’d)
Maximum and Minimum Option Prices
Call price cannot
be negative
exceed stock price
be less than price implied by put-call parity using zero for put price:

Put price cannot
be more than the strike price
be less than price implied by put-call parity using zero for put price:

Properties of Option Prices (cont’d)
Early exercise for American options
An American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock should not be exercised early, because
That means, one would lose money be exercising early instead of selling the option
If there are dividends, it may be optimal to exercise early, just prior to a dividend  
It may be optimal to exercise a non-dividend-paying put option early if the underlying stock price is sufficiently low
9

Properties of Option Prices (cont’d)
Time to Expiration
An American option (both put and call) with more time to expiration is at least as valuable as an American option with less time to expiration.  This is because the longer option can easily be converted into the shorter option by exercising it early
A European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock will be more valuable than an otherwise identical option with less time to expiration. 
European call options on dividend-paying stock and European puts may be less valuable than an otherwise identical option with less time to expiration
When the strike price grows at the rate of interest, European call and put prices on a non-dividend-paying stock increases with time to maturity
10

Properties of Option Prices (cont’d)
Different strike prices (K1 < K2 < K3), for both European and American options
A call with a low strike price is at least as valuable as an otherwise identical call with higher strike price

A put with a high strike price is at least as valuable as an otherwise identical call with low strike price

The premium difference between otherwise identical calls with different strike prices cannot be greater than the difference in strike prices
11

Properties of Option Prices (cont’d)
Different strike prices (K1 < K2 < K3), for both European and American options
The premium difference between otherwise identical puts with different strike prices cannot be greater than the difference in strike prices

Premiums decline at a decreasing rate for calls with progressively higher strike prices.  (Convexity of option price with respect to strike price)

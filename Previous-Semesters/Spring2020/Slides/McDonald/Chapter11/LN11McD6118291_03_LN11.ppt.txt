Binomial Option Pricing: Selected Topics

Understanding Early Exercise
Options may be rationally exercised prior to expiration
By exercising, the option holder
Receives the stock and thus receives dividends
Pays the strike price prior to expiration (this has an interest cost)
Loses the insurance implicit in the call against the possibility that the stock price will be less than the strike price at expiration

Understanding Early Exercise
If volatility is zero, the value of insurance is zero. Then, it is optimal to defer exercise as long as interest savings on the strike exceed dividends lost

Therefore, it is optimal to exercise when
	In the special case when r = δ and σ = 0, any in-the-money option should be exercised immediately
When volatility is positive, the implicit insurance has value that varies with time to expiration

Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing
 A risk-neutral investor is indifferent between a sure thing and a risky bet with an expected payoff equal to the value of the sure thing
p* is the risk-neutral probability that the stock price will go up
6

Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing (Cont’d)
The option pricing formula can be said to price options as if investors are risk-neutral
Note that we are not assuming that investors are actually risk-neutral, and that risky assets are actually expected to earn the risk-free rate of return
7

Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities
Is option pricing consistent with standard discounted cash flow calculations?
Yes. However, discounted cash flow is not used in practice to price options
This is because it is necessary to compute the option price in order to compute the correct discount rate
8

Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont’d)
Suppose that the continuously compounded expected return on the stock is α and that the stock does not pay dividends
If p is the true probability of the stock going up, p must be consistent with u, d, and α

(11.3)
Solving for p gives us
(11.4)
9

Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont’d)
Using p, the actual expected payoff to the option one period hence is 
(11.5)
At what rate do we discount this expected payoff?
It is not correct to discount the option at the expected return on the stock, α, because the option is equivalent to a leveraged investment in the stock and hence is riskier than the stock
10

Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont’d)
Denote the appropriate per-period discount rate for the option as γ
Since an option is equivalent to holding a portfolio consisting of Δ shares of stock and B bonds, the expected return on this portfolio is 
(11.6)
11

Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont’d)
We can now compute the option price as the expected option payoff, equation(11.5), discounted at the appropriate discount rate, given by equation (11.6). This gives 
(11.7)
12

Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont’d)
It turns out that this gives us the same option price as performing the risk-neutral calculation
Note that it does not matter whether we have the “correct” value of α to start with
Any consistent pair of α and γ will give the same option price
Risk-neutral pricing is valuable because setting α = r results in the simplest pricing procedure.
13

The Binomial Tree and Lognormality
The usefulness of the binomial pricing model hinges on the binomial tree providing a reasonable representation of the stock price distribution
The binomial tree approximates a lognormal distribution
14

The Random Walk Model
It is sometimes said that stock prices follow a random walk
Imagine that we flip a coin repeatedly 
Let the random variable Y denote the outcome of the flip 
If the coin lands displaying a head, Y = 1; otherwise, Y = – 1
If the probability of a head is 50%, we say the coin is fair
After n flips, with the ith flip denoted Yi, the cumulative total, Zn, is
(11.8)
It turns out that the more times we flip, on average the farther we will move from where we start
15

The Random Walk Model (cont’d)
We can represent the process followed by Zn in term of the change in Zn
Zn – Zn-1 = Yn
or
Heads: Zn – Zn-1 = +1
Tails: Zn – Zn-1 = –1
16

The Random Walk Model (cont’d)
A random walk, where with heads, the change in Z is 1, and with tails, the change in Z is – 1
17

The Random Walk Model (cont’d)
The idea that asset prices should follow a random walk was articulated in Samuelson (1965)
In efficient markets, an asset price should reflect all available information. In response to new information the price is equally likely to move up or down, as with the coin flip
The price after a period of time is the initial price plus the cumulative up and down movements due to informational surprises
18

Modeling Stock Prices As a Random Walk
The above description of a random walk is not a satisfactory description of stock price movements. There are at least three problems with this model
If by chance we get enough cumulative down movements, the stock price will become negative
The magnitude of the move ($1) should depend upon how quickly the coin flips occur and the level of the stock price
The stock, on average, should have a positive return. The random walk model taken literally does not permit this
The binomial model is a variant of the random walk model that solves all of these problems at once

The Binomial Model
The binomial model is	
Taking logs, we obtain	
(11.11)
Since ln(St+h/St) is the continuously compounded return from t to t + h, the binomial model is simply a particular way to model the continuously compounded return
That return has two parts, one of which is certain, (r–δ)h, and the other of which is uncertain and generates the up and down stock prices moves (plus or minus σ√h)

The Binomial Model (cont’d)
Equation (11.11) solves the three problems in the random walk
The stock price cannot become negative
As h gets smaller, up and down moves get smaller
There is a (r – δ)h term, and we can choose the probability of an up move, so we can guarantee that the expected change in the stock price is positive

Lognormality and the Binomial Model
The binomial tree approximates a lognormal distribution, which is commonly used to model stock prices
The lognormal distribution is the probability distribution that arises from the assumption that continuously compounded returns on the stock are normally distributed
With the lognormal distribution, the stock price is positive, and the distribution is skewed to the right, that is, there is a chance that extremely high stock prices will occur
22

Lognormality and the BinomialModel (cont’d)
The binomial model implicitly assigns probabilities to the various nodes.
23

Lognormality and the Binomial Model (cont’d)
The following graph compares the probability distribution for a 25-period binomial tree with the corresponding lognormal distribution
24

Alternative Binomial Trees
There are other ways besides equation (11.11) to construct a binomial tree that approximates a lognormal distribution
An acceptable tree must match the standard deviation of the continuously compounded return on the asset and must generate an appropriate distribution as h → 0
Different methods of constructing the binomial tree will result in different u and d stock movements
No matter how we construct the tree, we use
	to determine the risk-neutral probability and 
    to determine the option value
25

Alternative Binomial Trees (cont’d)
The Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial tree
The tree is constructed as 
(11.13)
A problem with this approach is that if h is large or σ is small, it is possible that	            , in which case the binomial tree violates the restriction of 
In real applications, h would be small, so the above problem does not occur
26

Alternative Binomial Trees (cont’d)
The lognormal tree
The tree is constructed as 
(11.14) 
All three methods of constructing a binomial tree yield different option prices for finite n, but they approach the same price as n → ∞
27

Is the Binomial Model Realistic?
The binomial model is a form of the random walk model, adapted to modeling stock prices. The lognormal random walk model in this section assumes among other things, that
Volatility is constant
“Large” stock price movements do not occur
Returns are independent over time
All of these assumptions appear to be violated in the data
28

Stock Paying Discrete Dividends
Suppose that a dividend will be paid between times t and t + h and that its future value at time t + h is D
The time t forward price for delivery at t + h is

Since the stock price at time t + h will be ex-dividend, we create the up and down moves based on the ex-dividend stock price
(11.15)
29

Stock Paying Discrete Dividends (cont’d)
When a dividend is paid, we have to account for the fact that the stock earns the dividend
The solution is 
Because the dividend is known, we decrease the bond position by the present value of the certain dividend
30

Problems With the Discrete Dividend Tree
The conceptual problem with equation (11.15) is that the stock price could in principle become negative if there have been large downward moves in the stock prior to the dividend
The practical problem is that the tree does not completely recombine after a discrete dividend
The following tree, where a $5 dividend is paid between periods 1 and 2, demonstrates that with a discrete dividend, the order of up and down movements affects the price
In the third binomial period, there are six rather than four possible stock prices

A Binomial Tree Using the Prepaid Forward
Schroder (1988) presents a method of constructing a tree for a dividend-paying stock that solves both problems
If we know for certain that a stock will pay a fixed dividend, then we can view the stock price as being the sum of two components
The dividend, which is like a zero-coupon bond with zero volatility, and 
The present value of the ex-dividend value of the stock, i.e., the prepaid forward price
33

A Binomial Tree Using the Prepaid Forward (cont’d)
Suppose we know that a stock will pay a dividend D at time TD < T, where T is the expiration date of the option
We base stock price movements on the prepaid forward price	
As before, we have up and down movements of	
The observed stock price at t + h < TD is then
Assign a volatility to the prepaid forward using the ad hoc adjustment

The Black-Scholes Formula

Black-Scholes Formula
The Black-Scholes formula is a limiting case of the binomial formula (infinitely many periods) for the price of a European option.
Consider an European call (or put) option written on a stock
Assume that the stock pays dividend at the continuous rate δ

Black-Scholes Assumptions
Assumptions about stock return distribution
Continuously compounded returns on the stock are normally distributed and independent over time (no “jumps”)
The volatility of continuously compounded returns is known and constant
Future dividends are known, either as dollar amount or as a fixed dividend yield

Black-Scholes Assumptions (cont’d)
Assumptions about the economic environment
The risk-free rate is known and constant
There are no transaction costs or taxes
It is possible to short-sell costlessly and to borrow at the risk-free rate

Options on Stocks with Discrete Dividends
The prepaid forward price for stock with discrete dividends is
Examples 12.3 and 12.1
S = $41, K = $40, σ = 0.3, r = 8%, t = 0.25, Div = $3 in one month
PV (Div) = $3e-0.08/12 = $2.98
Use $41– $2.98 = $38.02 as the stock price in BS formula
The BS European call price is $1.763
Compare this to European call on stock without dividends: $3.399

Options on Currencies
The prepaid forward price for  the currency is
Where x0 is domestic spot rate and rf is foreign interest rate
Example 12.4
x0 =  $1.25/   , K = $1.20, σ = 0.10, r = 1%, T = 1, and rf = 3%
The price of a dollar-denominated euro call is $0.061407
The price of a dollar-denominated euro put is $0.03641

Options on Futures
The prepaid forward price for a futures contract is the PV of the futures price.  Therefore
where
						and
Example 12.5: 
Suppose 1-yr. futures price for natural gas is $6.50/MMBtu, r = 2% 
Therefore, F=$6.50, K=$6.50, and r = 2% 
If σ = 0.25, T= 1, call price = put price = $0.63379

Option Greeks
What happens to the option price when one and only one input changes?
Delta (Δ): change in option price when stock price increases by $1
Gamma (Γ): change in delta when option price increases by $1
Vega: change in option price when volatility increases by 1%
Theta (θ): change in option price when time to maturity decreases by 1 day
Rho (ρ): change in option price when interest rate increases by 1%
Greek measures for portfolios
The Greek measure of a portfolio is weighted average of Greeks of individual portfolio components

Option elasticity (Ω)
Ω describes the risk of the option relative to the risk of the stock in percentage terms: If stock price (S) changes by 1%, what is the percent change in the value of the option (C)?
Example 12.8: S = $41, K = $40, σ = 0.30, r = 0.08, T = 1, δ = 0
Elasticity for call: Ω = S Δ /C = $41 x 0.6911 / $6.961 = 4.071
Elasticity for put: Ω = S Δ /C = $41 x  – 0.3089 / $2.886 =  – 4.389

Implied Volatility
Volatility is unobservable
Option prices, particularly for near-the-money options, can be quite sensitive to volatility
One approach is to compute historical volatility using the history of returns
A problem with historical volatility is that expected future volatility can be different from historical volatility. 
Alternatively, we can calculate implied volatility, which is the volatility that, when put into a pricing formula (typically Black-Scholes), yields the observed option price.

Implied Volatility (cont’d)
In practice implied volatilities of in-, at-, and out-of-the money options are generally different
A volatility smile refers to when volatility is symmetric, with volatility lowest for at-the-money options, and high for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options
A difference in volatilities between in-the-money and out-of-the-money options is referred to as a volatility skew

Implied Volatility (cont’d)

Implied Volatility (cont’d)
Some practical uses of implied volatility include
Use the implied volatility from an option with an observable price to calculate the price of another option on the same underlying asset
Use implied volatility as a quick way to describe the level of options prices on a given underlying asset: you could quote option prices in terms of volatility, rather than as a dollar price
Checking the uniformity of implied volatilities across various options on the same underlying assets allows one to verify the validity of the pricing model in pricing those options

Perpetual American Options
Perpetual American options (options that never expire) are optimally exercised when the underlying asset ever reaches the optimal exercise barrier (Hc for a call and Hp for a put)
For a perpetual call option the optimal exercise barrier and price are

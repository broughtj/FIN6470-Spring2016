Chapter 13
Market-Making and Delta-Hedging

What Do Market Makers Do?
Provide immediacy by standing ready to sell to buyers (at ask price) and to buy from sellers (at bid price)
Generate inventory as needed by short-selling
Profit by charging the bid-ask spread

What Do Market Makers Do? (cont’d)
The position of a market-maker is the result of whatever order flow arrives from customers
Proprietary trading, which is conceptually distinct from market-making, is trading to express an investment strategy

Market-Maker Risk
Market makers attempt to hedge in order to avoid the risk from their arbitrary positions due to customer orders 
Market-makers can control risk by delta-hedging
Delta-hedged positions should expect to earn risk-free return

Delta (Δ) and gamma (Γ) as measures of exposure
Suppose Δ is 0.5824, when S = $40 (Table 13.1 and Figure 13.1)    
A $0.75 increase in stock price would be expected to increase option price by $0.4368 (= $0.75 x 0.5824)     
The actual increase in the option’s value is higher: $0.4548
This discrepancy occurs because Δ increases as stock price increases.  Using the smaller Δ at the lower stock price understates the actual change 
Similarly, using the original Δ overstates the change in the option value as a response to a stock price decline
Using Γ in addition to Δ improves the approximation of the option value change

Delta-Hedging
Suppose a market-maker sells one option, and buys Δ shares
Delta hedging for 2 days: (daily rebalancing and mark-to-market):
Day 0: Share price = $40, call price is $2.7804, and Δ = 0.5824 
Sell call written on 100 shares for $278.04, and buy 58.24 shares.  
Net investment:  (58.24x$40) – $278.04 = $2051.56
At 8%, overnight financing charge is $0.45  [= $2051.56x(e0.08/365-1)]
Day 1: If share price = $40.5, call price is $3.0621, and Δ = 0.6142
Overnight profit/loss: $29.12 – $28.17 – $0.45 = $0.50
Buy 3.18 additional shares for $128.79 to rebalance 
Day 2: If share price = $39.25, call price is $2.3282 
Overnight profit/loss:  – $76.78 + $73.39 – $0.48 =  – $3.87

Γ: For large decreases in stock price, Δ decreases, and the option increases in value slower than the loss in stock value.  For large increases in stock price Δ increases, and the option decreases in value faster than the gain in stock value.  In both cases the net loss increases and the market-maker loses money.  For small moves in the stock price, the market-maker makes money.
θ : If a day passes with no change in the stock price, the option becomes cheaper.  Since the option position is short, this time decay increases the profits of the market-maker.
Interest cost: In creating the hedge, the market-maker purchases the stock with borrowed funds.  The carrying cost of the stock position decreases the profits of the market-maker.

Mathematics of ∆-Hedging
  Δ−Γ approximations
Recall the under (over) estimation of the new option value using Δ alone when stock price moved up (down) by ε.  (ε = St+h – St)
Using the Δ−Γ approximation the accuracy can be improved a lot
Example 13.1:  S: $40      $40.75, C: $2.7804     $3.2352,  Γ: 0.0652
Using Δ approximation
	C($40.75) = C($40) + 0.75 x 0.5824 = $3.2172 
Using Δ−Γ approximation
    C($40.75) = C($40) + 0.75 x 0.5824 + 0.5 x 0.752 x 0.0652 = $3.2355
Similarly, for a stock price decline to $39.25, the true option price is $2.3622. The Δ approximation gives $23436, and the Δ−Γ approximation gives $2.3619.

The Black-Scholes Analysis
Black-Scholes partial differential equation
where Γ, Δ, and θ are partial derivatives of the option price computed at t
Under the following assumptions:
Underlying asset and the option do not pay dividends
Interest rate and volatility are constant
The stock does not make large discrete moves
The equation is valid only when early exercise is not optimal

The Black-Scholes Analysis (cont’d)
Advantage of frequent re-hedging
Varhourly = 1/24 x Vardaily 	
By hedging hourly instead of daily, total return variance is reduced by a factor of 24
The more frequent hedger benefits from diversification over time
Three ways for protecting against extreme price moves
Adopt a Γ-neutral position by using options to hedge
Augment the portfolio by buying deep-out-of-the-money puts and calls as insurance
Use static option replication according to put-call parity to form a Γ- and Δ-neutral hedge

Market-Making As Insurance
Insurance companies have two ways of dealing with unexpectedly large loss claims:
Hold capital reserves
Diversify risk by buying reinsurance
Market-makers also have two analogous ways to deal with excessive losses:
Hold capital to cushion against less-diversifiable risks
Reinsure by trading in out-of-the-money options
When risks are not fully diversifiable, holding capital is inevitable

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>This course covers modern derivatives markets from the economic, institutional, and quantitative perspectives. The foundational principle of all of economics is the Arbitrage Principle. We will undertake an in-depth study of the Arbitrage Principle from several perspectives including the neoclassical and Austrian schools of thought. We will also discuss modern developments such as the influence of artificial intelligence and machine learning upon the operation of derivatives markets.</p>

<h3 id="methods-of-teaching-and-learning">Methods of Teaching and Learning</h3>
<p>This course will be taught as a graduate seminar style course. That means that your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course what you individually and collectively put in.</p>
<p>I will use the Socratic method as much as feasible during class sections. I will aso present standard chalk-and-talk style lectures for background material, but here too I will employ the Socratic method.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your preparation and participation is absolutely essential!</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>
<p>The grade that you will earn will be determined by your ranking in the class based on the weighted total points accumulated. There is not a predetermined percentage of the class that will get an A or that will fail. If you all do excellent work, you will all earn exceptional grades. The weights given to each part of the class are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Class Preparation and Participation (10%) - Your preparation is crucial! No student can earn an A without meeting these requirements!</p></li>
<li><p>Homework (10%) - There will be weekly homework assignments that will consist of numerical and computational problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Presentations (5%) - You will each be given the opportunity to present at least once in class. Your presentation should go for 20 minutes (15 minutes for content, and 5 minutes for discussion and questions). You must email the professor a PDF file of your presentation at least two days prior to your presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotated Bibliography (15%) - You will complete an annotated bibliography of the various readings assigned throughout the semester. This will become a valuable asset when completing your midterm and final exams. I will demonstrate how to create this document in class, and resources will be uploaded to Canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Midterm Exam (30%) - The midterm will be a take-home exam. You will have two weeks to complete it. You will take it at the end of Module II.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Exam (30%) - The final exam will a take-home final exam. You will have two weeks to complete it. It will cover material from Module III.</p></li>
</ul>

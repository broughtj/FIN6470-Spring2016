## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course covers modern derivatives markets from the economic, institutional, and
quantitative perspectives. The foundational principle of all of economics is the
Arbitrage Principle. We will undertake an in-depth study of the Arbitrage Principle
from several perspectives including the neoclassical and Austrian schools of thought.
We will also discuss modern developments such as the influence of artificial intelligence
and machine learning upon the operation of derivatives markets.


### Textbooks

There is only one _required_ textbook for this course:

* [Derivatives Markets 3rd Edition][McDonald] by Robert McDonald.

I will also use some other books for some lecture material. Some of these other books are the following:

* [Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives 9th Edition][Hull] by John Hull (sometimes called the bible of option pricing)

* [Risk Transfer][Culp] by Christopher Culp (a gem of a book with a fresh perspective)

* [The Economic Function of Futures Markets][Williams] by Jeffrey Williams (entirely mind-bending perspective)

There will be many additional readings from academic articles assigned throughout the semester. __This course is reading intensive
so please be prepared to read thoroughly and discuss the readings__. 


### Methods of Teaching and Learning

This course will be taught as a graduate seminar style course. That means that your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course
what you individually and collectively put in. 

I will use the Socratic method as much as feasible during class sections. I will aso present standard chalk-and-talk style lectures for 
background material, but here too I will employ the Socratic method. 

___Your preparation and participation is absolutely essential!___


### Assessment 

The grade that you will earn will be determined by your ranking in the class based on the weighted total points
accumulated. There is not a predetermined percentage of the class that will get an A or that will fail. If you all
do excellent work, you will all earn exceptional grades. The weights given to each part of the class are as follows:

* Class Preparation and Participation (10%) - Your preparation is crucial! No student can earn an A without meeting these
  requirements! 

* Homework (10%) - There will be weekly homework assignments that will consist of numerical and computational problems.

* Presentations (5%) - You will each be given the opportunity to present at least once in class. Your presentation should go for
  20 minutes (15 minutes for content, and 5 minutes for discussion and questions). You must email the professor a PDF file of your
  presentation at least two days prior to your presentation.

* Annotated Bibliography (15%) - You will complete an annotated bibliography of the various readings assigned throughout the semester. 
  This will become a valuable asset when completing your midterm and final exams. I will demonstrate how to create this document in class, 
  and resources will be uploaded to Canvas.

* Midterm Exam (30%) - The midterm will be a take-home exam. You will have two weeks to complete it. You will take it at the end of Module II.

* Final Exam (30%) - The final exam will a take-home final exam. You will have two weeks to complete it. It will cover material from Module III.


#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email.
Students will be invited to the [Fin 6470 Slack channel](https://fin6470-usu.slack.com) prior to the first week of
class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be
[downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client
via a desktop browser.

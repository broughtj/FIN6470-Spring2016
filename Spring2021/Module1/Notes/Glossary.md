___Arbitrage:___ 

__1.__ (_Williams 1995_) in its simplest form, arbitrage is the purchase in one market at a low price while simultaneously selling at a higher price in another market, that price more than covering the relevant transportation expenses, storage fees, interest costs, and so forth. The positions in an arbitrage operation need not involve the immediate delivery and redelivery of the commodity; the positions could be held for some time. Nor need the arbitrage operation be absolutely riskless. These risks, however, are difficult to anticipate and extreme, such as the abrogation of all commercial contracts upon a declaration of war. Under this definition, the phrase "risk arbitrage" is a contradiction and an obfuscation.
